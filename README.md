# Labrynth of Lies
Labyrinth of Lies is a web-based game modeled after the board game Clue. In our game, the player takes the perspective of a detective solving a case. They are presented with the facts and asked to make a decision. 

Functionality: The features of the game include:
- Choose Your Own Adventure Game - The game is able to track the user‚Äôs decisions and what to do next based on their decision. 
- Menu bar - The game has a menu bar that allows for user navigation and control.
- Immersive Game Design - The game implements a design that allows the player to feel like they are an actual detective as the color schemes and case files are modeled to follow the theme of detectives and crime scenes.

After the user gets bored of the game or they have solved everything, there is a "retire" option that they can click on. In the retire browser, they can see what actually happened in the case and who is guilty.
